However, the non-negligible incongruence in their relaxation methods is hard to guarantee the differentiable optimization in the continuous space is equivalent to the optimization in the discrete space. Differently, this paper utilizes a variational graph autoencoder to injectively transform the discrete architecture space into an equivalently continuous latent space, to resolve the incongruence. A probabilistic exploration enhancement method is accordingly devised to encourage intelligent exploration during the architecture search in the latent space, to avoid local optimal in architecture search. As the catastrophic forgetting in differentiable One-Shot NAS deteriorates supernet predictive ability and makes the bilevel optimization inefficient, this paper further proposes an architecture complementation method to relieve this deficiency. We analyze the effectiveness of the proposed method, and a series of experiments have been conducted to compare the proposed method with state-of-the-art One-Shot NAS methods.","tags":["Neural Architecture Search","Graph Neural Networks"],"title":"Differentiable Neural Architecture Search in Equivalent Space with Exploration Enhancement","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Shichao Zhu","Shirui Pan","Chuan Zhou","Jia Wu","Yanan Cao","Bin Wang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1600992000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1600992000,"objectID":"f10e87497b1a6730f48a07f7937f7970","permalink":"https://shiruipan.github.io/publication/neurips-20-zhu/","publishdate":"2020-09-25T12:19:12.824998Z","relpermalink":"/publication/neurips-20-zhu/","section":"publication","summary":"While numerous approaches have been developed to embed graphs into either Euclidean or hyperbolic spaces, they do not fully utilize the information available in graphs, or lack the flexibility to model intrinsic complex graph geometry.

To improve the rigidness and inflexibility of deterministic classification functions, this paper proposes a novel framework named Graph Stochastic Neural Networks (GSNN), which aims to model the uncertainty of the classification function by simultaneously learning a family of functions, i.e., a stochastic function. Specifically, we introduce a learnable graph neural network coupled with a high-dimensional latent variable to model the distribution of the classification function, and further adopt the amortised variational inference to approximate the intractable joint posterior for missing labels and the latent variable. By maximizing the lower-bound of the likelihood for observed node labels, the instantiated models can be trained in an end-to-end manner effectively.

Most recent graph embedding methods focus on attributed graphs, since they preserve both structure and content information in the network. However, corruption can exist in the graph structure as well as the node content of the graph, and both can lead to inferior embedding results. Unfortunately, few existing graph embedding algorithms have considered the corruption problem, and to the best of our knowledge, none has studied structural corruption in attributed graphs, including missing and redundant edges. This field is difficult for previous methods, mainly due to two challenges: (1) the existence of various corruption causes has made it difficult to recognize corruptions in graphs, and (2) the complexity of graph-structured data has increased the difficulty of handling corruption therein for graph embedding methods. These facts lead us here to propose a novel autoencoder-based graph embedding approach, which is robust against structural corruption. Our idea comes from the recent discovery of memorization effects in deep learning. Namely, deep neural networks prefer to fit clean data first, before they over-fit corrupted data. Specifically, we train two autoencoders simultaneously and let them learn the reliability of the edges in the graph from each other. The two autoencoders would evaluate the edges according to their reconstructed structure and manipulate this by devaluing those distrusted edges to update the structure information. The updated structure would be used further in the next iteration as the ground-truth of its peer-network. Experiments on different versions of real-world graphs show state-of-the-art results and demonstrate the robustness of our model against structural corruption.","tags":["Graph Neural Networks"],"title":"Cross-Graph: Robust and Unsupervised Embedding for Attributed Graphs with Corrupted Structure","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Man Wu","Shirui Pan","Xingquan Zhu"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1597881600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1597881600,"objectID":"4eece83da8481138bb874419b8f01de2","permalink":"https://shiruipan.github.io/publication/icdm-20-wu/","publishdate":"2020-08-20T12:19:12.824998Z","relpermalink":"/publication/icdm-20-wu/","section":"publication","summary":"In traditional graph learning tasks, such as node classification, the learning is carried out in a closed-world setting where the number of classes and their training samples are provided to help train models, and the learning goal is to correctly classify unlabeled nodes into classes already known. In reality, due to limited labeling capability and dynamic evolving of networks, some nodes in the networks may not belong to any existing/seen classes, and therefore cannot be correctly classified by closed-world learning algorithms. In this paper, we propose a new open-world graph learning paradigm, where the learning goal is to not only classify nodes belonging to seen classes into correct groups, but also classify nodes not belonging to existing classes to an unseen class. The essential challenge of the open-world graph learning is that (1) unseen class has no labeled samples, and may exist in an arbitrary form different from existing seen classes; and (2) both graph feature learning and prediction should differentiate whether a node may belong to an existing/seen class or an unseen class. To tackle the challenges, we propose an uncertain node representation learning approach, using constrained variational graph autoencoder networks, where the label loss and class uncertainty loss constraints are used to ensure that the node representation learning are sensitive to unseen class. As a result, the node embedding features are denoted by distributions, instead of deterministic feature vectors. By using a sampling process to generate multiple versions of feature vectors, we are able to test the certainty of a node belonging to seen classes, and automatically determine a threshold to reject nodes not belonging to seen classes as unseen class nodes. Experiments on real-world networks demonstrate the algorithm performance, comparing to baselines. Case studies and ablation analysis also show the rationale of our design for open-world graph learning.

A basic assumption behind multivariate time series forecasting is that its variables depend on one another but, upon looking closely, it's fair to say that existing methods fail to fully exploit latent spatial dependencies between pairs of variables. In recent years, meanwhile, graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown high capability in handling relational dependencies. GNNs require well-defined graph structures for information propagation which means they cannot be applied directly for multivariate time series where the dependencies are not known in advance. In this paper, we propose a general graph neural network framework designed specifically for multivariate time series data. Our approach automatically extracts the uni-directed relations among variables through a graph learning module, into which external knowledge like variable attributes can be easily integrated. A novel mix-hop propagation layer and a dilated inception layer are further proposed to capture the spatial and temporal dependencies within the time series. The graph learning, graph convolution, and temporal convolution modules are jointly learned in an end-to-end framework. Experimental results show that our proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline methods on 3 of 4 benchmark datasets and achieves on-par performance with other approaches on two traffic datasets which provide extra structural information..","tags":["Time Series","Graph Neural Networks"],"title":"Connecting the Dots: Multivariate Time Series Forecasting with Graph Neural Networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zhihui Li","Xiaojun Chang","Lina Yao","Shirui Pan","Zongyuan Ge","Huaxiang Zhang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1589544949,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1589544949,"objectID":"bb67fd7fa1c17c775ac1d8122e04fdb6","permalink":"https://shiruipan.github.io/publication/kdd-2020-li/","publishdate":"2020-05-15T12:15:49.436331Z","relpermalink":"/publication/kdd-2020-li/","section":"publication","summary":"The flourishing of social media platforms requires techniques for understanding the content of media on a large scale.

Accordingly, in this paper, we propose a method of grounding visual concepts for large-scale Multimedia Event Detection (MED) and Multimedia Event Captioning (MEC) in zero-shot setting. More specifically, our framework composes the following: (1) deriving the novel semantic representations of events from their textual descriptions, rather than event names; (2) aggregating the ranks of grounded concepts for MED tasks. A statistical mean-shift outlier rejection model is proposed to remove the outlying concepts which are incorrectly grounded; and (3) defining MEC tasks and augmenting the MEC training set by the videos detected in MED in a zero-shot setting. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first time to define and solve the MEC task, which is a further step towards understanding video events.

Due to the principle of ternary closures and the trend of group formation, the multivariate relationships in social networks are complex and rich. Therefore, in graph learning tasks of social networks, the identification and utilization of multivariate relationship information are more important. Existing graph learning methods are based on the neighborhood information diffusion mechanism, which often leads to partial omission or even lack of multivariate relationship information, and ultimately affects the accuracy and execution efficiency of the task. To address these challenges, this paper proposes the multivariate relationship aggregation learning (MORE) method, which can effectively capture the multivariate relationship information in the network environment. By aggregating node attribute features and structural features, MORE achieves higher accuracy and faster convergence speed. We conducted experiments on one citation network and five social networks. The experimental results show that the MORE model has higher accuracy than the GCN (Graph Convolutional Network) model in node classification tasks, and can significantly reduce time cost.","tags":["Time Series","Graph Neural Networks"],"title":"Multivariate Relations Aggregation Learning in Social Networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sheng Wan","Ping Zhong","Shirui Pan","Jian Yang","Guangyu Li","Chen Gong"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1587859200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1587859200,"objectID":"31d662c6e9d8d0c37e40bba619bfe36b","permalink":"https://shiruipan.github.io/publication/tgrs-2020-wan/","publishdate":"2020-04-26T12:15:49.437666Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tgrs-2020-wan/","section":"publication","summary":"In hyperspectral image (HSI) classification, spatial context has demonstrated its significance in achieving promising performance. However, conventional spatial context-based methods simply assume that spatially neighboring pixels should correspond to the same land-cover class, so they often fail to correctly discover the contextual relations among pixels in complex situations, and thus leading to imperfect classification results on some irregular or inhomogeneous regions such as class boundaries. To address this deficiency, we develop a new HSI classification method based on the recently proposed Graph Convolutional Network (GCN), as it can flexibly encode the relations among arbitrarily structured non-Euclidean data. Different from traditional GCN, there are two novel strategies adopted by our method to further exploit the contextual relations for accurate HSI classification. First, since the receptive field of traditional GCN is often limited to fairly small neighborhood, we proposed to capture long range contextual relations in HSI by performing successive graph convolutions on a learned region-induced graph which is transformed from the original 2D image grids. Second, we refine the graph edge weight and the connective relationships among image regions simultaneously by learning the improved similarity measurement and the ‘edge filter’, so that the graph can be gradually refined to adapt to the representations generated by each graph convolutional layer. Such updated graph will in turn result in faithful region representations, and vice versa. The experiments carried out on four real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.","tags":["Graph Neural Networks"],"title":"Hyperspectral Image Classification with Context-aware Dynamic Graph Convolutional Networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yue Yuan","Xiaofei Zhou","Shirui Pan","Qiannan Zhu","Zeliang Song","Li Guo"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1587340800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1587340800,"objectID":"285e33084b7a5a613e4ec835427543cc","permalink":"https://shiruipan.github.io/publication/ijcai-2020-yuan/","publishdate":"2020-04-20T12:15:49.436331Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ijcai-2020-yuan/","section":"publication","summary":"Joint extraction of entities and relations is an important task in natural language processing (NLP), which aims to capture all relational triplets from plain texts.

However, increasing research has found that there is no positive correlation between the above validation accuracy and test accuracy for these One-Shot NAS methods, and this reward based sampling for supernet training also entails the rich-get-richer problem. To handle this deceptive problem, this paper presents a new approach, Efficient Novelty-driven Neural Architecture Search (EN2AS), to sample the most abnormal architecture to train the supernet. Specifically, a single-path supernet is adopted, and only the weights of the single architecture sampled by our novelty search are optimized in each step to reduce the memory demand greatly.

In order to deal with the situation, we propose a novel Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning framework to learn chains of reasoning from a Knowledge Graph automatically. Our framework is inspired by the hierarchical structure through which human handle cognitionally ambiguous cases. The whole reasoning process is decomposed into a hierarchy of two-level Reinforcement Learning policies for encoding historical information and learning structured action space. As a consequence, it is more feasible and natural for dealing with the multiple semantic issue. Experimental results show that our proposed model achieves substantial improvements in ambiguous relation tasks.","tags":["Reinforcement Learning","Relational Learning","Knowledge Graphs"],"title":"Reasoning Like Human: Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning for Knowledge Graph Reasoning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zonghan Wu","Shirui Pan","Fengwen Chen","Guodong Long","Chengqi Zhang","Philip S Yu"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1583107200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1583107200,"objectID":"025bd115b28e3cfe65b33a988eab2ac1","permalink":"https://shiruipan.github.io/publication/wu-2019-comprehensive/","publishdate":"2020-03-02T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/wu-2019-comprehensive/","section":"publication","summary":"Deep learning has revolutionized many machine learning tasks in recent years, ranging from image classification and video processing to speech recognition and natural language understanding. The data in these tasks are typically represented in the Euclidean space. However, there is an increasing number of applications where data are generated from non-Euclidean domains and are represented as graphs with complex relationships and interdependency between objects. The complexity of graph data has imposed significant challenges on existing machine learning algorithms. Recently, many studies on extending deep learning approaches for graph data have emerged. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of graph neural networks (GNNs) in data mining and machine learning fields. We propose a new taxonomy to divide the state-of-the-art graph neural networks into four categories, namely recurrent graph neural networks, convolutional graph neural networks, graph autoencoders and spatial-temporal graph neural networks. We further discuss the applications of graph neural networks across various domains and summarize the open source codes and benchmarks of the existing algorithms on different learning tasks.

However, this approach also introduces multi-model forgetting during the supernet training (architecture search phase), where the performance of previous architectures degrade when sequentially training new architectures with partially-shared weights. To overcome such catastrophic forgetting, the state-of-the-art method assumes that the shared weights are optimal when jointly optimizing a posterior probability. However, this strict assumption is not necessarily held for One-Shot NAS in practice. In this paper, we formulate the supernet training in the One-Shot NAS as a constrained optimization problem of continual learning that the learning of current architecture should not degrade the performance of previous architectures during the supernet training. We propose a Novelty Search based Architecture Selection (NSAS) loss function and demonstrate that the posterior probability could be calculated without the strict assumption when maximizing the diversity of the selected constraints. A greedy novelty search method is devised to find the most representative subset to regularize the supernet training. We apply our proposed approach to two One-Shot NAS baselines, random sampling NAS (RandomNAS) and gradient-based sampling NAS (GDAS). Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method enhances the predictive ability of the supernet in One-Shot NAS and achieves remarkable performance on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and PTB with efficiency.","tags":["Neural Architecture Search","Deep Learning","AutoML"],"title":"Overcoming Multi-Model Forgetting in One-Shot NAS with Diversity Maximization","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Shaoxiong Ji","Shirui Pan","Erik Cambria","Pekka Marttinen","Philip S Yu"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1580601600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1580601600,"objectID":"7e2bdd70af1ea6879970294f3104cccc","permalink":"https://shiruipan.github.io/publication/ji-2020-kg/","publishdate":"2020-02-03T13:36:24.239997Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ji-2020-kg/","section":"publication","summary":"Human knowledge provides a formal understanding of the world.

In this paper, we present a novel approach, unsupervised domain adaptive graph convolutional networks (UDA-GCN), for domain adaptation learning for graphs. To enable effective graph representation learning, we first develop a dual graph convolutional network component, which jointly exploits local and global consistency for feature aggregation. An attention mechanism is further used to produce a unified representation for each node in different graphs. To facilitate knowledge transfer between graphs, we propose a domain adaptive learning module to optimize three different loss functions, namely source classifier loss, domain classifier loss, and target classifier loss as a whole, thus our model can differentiate class labels in the source domain, samples from different domains, the class labels from the target domain, respectively.

To solve this problem, we present graph convolutional ladder-shape networks (GCLN), a novel graph neural network architecture that transmits messages from shallow layers to deeper layers to overcome the over-smoothing problem and dramatically extend the scale of the neural networks with improved performance. We have validated the effectiveness of proposed GCLN at a node-wise level with a semi-supervised task (node classification) and an unsupervised task (node clustering), and at a graph-wise level with graph classification by applying a differentiable pooling operation.

In this work, we present a novel framework, Meta-path Discovery with Reinforcement Learning (MPDRL), to identify informative meta-paths from complex and large-scale HINs. To capture different semantic information between objects, we propose a novel multi-hop reasoning strategy in a reinforcement learning framework which aims to infer the next promising relation that links a source entity to a target entity. To improve the efficiency, moreover, we develop a type context representation embedded approach to scale the RL framework to handle million-scale HINs. As multi-hop reasoning generates rich meta-paths with various length, we further perform a meta-path induction step to summarize the important meta-paths using Lowest Common Ancestor principle. Experimental results on two large-scale HINs, Yago and NELL, validate our approach and demonstrate that our algorithm not only achieves superior performance in the link prediction task, but also identifies useful meta-paths that would have been ignored by human experts.","tags":["Reinforcement Learning","Relational Learning","Heterogeneous Information Networks","Knowledge Graphs"],"title":"Reinforcement Learning based Meta-path Discovery in Large-scale Heterogeneous Information Networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yu Zheng","Ruiqi Hu","Sai-fu Fung","Celina Yu","Guodong Long","Ting Guo","Shirui Pan"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1578009600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1578009600,"objectID":"c335c2a18247930f605449970fb49aa5","permalink":"https://shiruipan.github.io/publication/pr-2019-zheng/","publishdate":"2020-01-03T11:36:51.672958Z","relpermalink":"/publication/pr-2019-zheng/","section":"publication","summary":"TBusiness information networks involve diverse users and rich content and have emerged as important platforms for enabling business intelligence and business decision making. A key step in an organizations business intelligence process is to cluster users with similar interests into social audiences and discover the roles they play within a business network. In this article, we propose a novel machine-learning approach, called CBIN, that co-clusters business information networks to discover and understand these audiences. The CBIN framework is based on co-factorization. The audience clusters are discovered from a combination of network structures and rich contextual information, such as node interactions and node-content correlations. Since what defines an audience cluster is data-driven, plus they often overlap, pre-determining the number of clusters is usually very difficult. Therefore, we have based CBIN on an overlapping clustering paradigm with a hold-out strategy to discover the optimal number of clusters given the underlying data.

The state-of-the-art Android malware clustering approaches rely heavily on the raw labels from commercial AntiVirus (AV) vendors, which causes misclustering for a substantial number of weakly-labeled malware due to the inconsistent, incomplete and overly generic labels reported by these closed-source AV engines, whose capabilities vary greatly and whose internal mechanisms are opaque (i.e., intermediate detection results are unavailable for clustering). The raw labels are thus often used as the only important source of information for clustering. To address the limitations of the existing approaches, this paper presents ANDRE, a new ANDroid Hybrid REpresentation Learning approach to clustering weakly-labeled Android malware by preserving heterogeneous information from multiple sources (including the results of static code analysis, the metainformation of an app, and the raw-labels of the AV vendors) to jointly learn a hybrid representation for accurate clustering. The learned representation is then fed into our outlieraware clustering to partition the weakly-labeled malware into known and unknown families. The malware whose malicious behaviours are close to those of the existing families on the network, are further classified using a three-layer Deep Neural Network (DNN). The unknown malware are clustered using a standard density-based clustering algorithm. We have evaluated our approach using 5,416 ground-truth malware from Drebin and 9,000 malware from VIRUSSHARE (uploaded between Mar. 2017 and Feb. 2018), consisting of 3324 weakly-labeled malware. The evaluation shows that ANDRE effectively clusters weaklylabeled malware which cannot be clustered by the state-of-theart approaches, while achieving comparable accuracy with those approaches for clustering ground-truth samples.","tags":["android malware","clustering","graph embedding"],"title":"Familial Clustering For Weakly-labeled Android Malware Using Hybrid Representation Learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1568678400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1568678400,"objectID":"e7c2df2a92b144990496a5de48fdd09e","permalink":"https://shiruipan.github.io/post/fullpublication/","publishdate":"2019-09-17T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/fullpublication/","section":"post","summary":" ","tags":null,"title":"Full Publication","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" I am looking for self-motivated Ph.D students funded by: (1) Monash Scholarships, and (2)China Scholarship Council (CSC).\n[28/11/2019] Phd positions are available.

However, the presence of noisy facts in automatically extracted or crowdsourcing KGs significantly reduces the reliability of various embedding learners. In this paper, we thoroughly study the underlying reasons for the performance drop in dealing with noisy knowledge graphs, and we propose an ensemble framework, Adaptive Knowledge Subgraph Ensemble (AKSE), to enhance the robustness and trust of knowledge graph completion. By employing an effective knowledge subgraph extraction approach to re-sample the sub-components from the original knowledge graph, AKSE generates different representations for learning diversified base learners (e.g., TransE and DistMult), which substantially alleviates the noise effect of KG embedding. All embedding learners are integrated into a unified framework to reduce generalization errors via our simple or adaptive weighting schemes, where the weight is allocated based on each individual learner’s prediction capacity. Experimental results show that the robustness of our ensemble framework outperforms exiting knowledge graph embedding approaches on manually injected noise as well as inherent noisy extracted KGs.","tags":["Knowledge graph","graph embedding"],"title":"Adaptive knowledge subgraph ensemble for robust and trustworthy knowledge graph completion","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jionghao Lin","Shirui Pan","Cheng Siong Lee","Sharon Oviatt"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1567296000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1567296000,"objectID":"e305b298adfb6aefed4edabe85e02ede","permalink":"https://shiruipan.github.io/publication/cikm-19-lin/","publishdate":"2019-09-05T12:19:12.827665Z","relpermalink":"/publication/cikm-19-lin/","section":"publication","summary":"Affective computing is an emerging research area which provides insights on human’s mental state through human-machine interaction.

On the one hand, data from other domains are often useful to improve the learning on the target domain; on the other hand, domain variance and hierarchical structure of documents from words, key phrases, sentences, paragraphs, etc. make it difficult to align domains for effective learning. To date, existing cross-domain text classification methods mainly strive to minimize feature distribution differences between domains, and they typically suffer from three major limitations — (1) difficult to capture semantics in non-consecutive phrases and long-distance word dependency because of treating texts as word sequences, (2) neglect of hierarchical coarse-grained structures of document for feature learning, and (3) narrow focus of the domains at instance levels, without using domains as supervisions to improve text classification. This paper proposes an end-to-end, domain-adversarial graph neural networks (DAGNN), for cross-domain text classification. Our motivation is to model documents as graphs and use a domain-adversarial training principle to lean features from each graph (as well as learning the separation of domains) for effective text classification. At the instance level, DAGNN uses a graph to model each document, so that it can capture non-consecutive and long-distance semantics. At the feature level, DAGNN uses graphs from different domains to jointly train hierarchical graph neural networks in order to learn good features. At the learning level, DAGNN proposes a domain-adversarial principle such that the learned features not only optimally classify documents but also separates domains.

In this article, we present a novel adversarially regularized framework for graph embedding.

The long-distance attention mechanism is used to capture the propagation of information within a localized area of each node and help model weights of different graphs for node representation learning.

In this paper, we propose Relation Structure-Aware Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (RSHN), a unified model that integrates graph and its coarsened line graph to embed both nodes and edges in heterogeneous graphs without requiring any prior knowledge such as meta-path. To tackle the heterogeneity of edge connections, RSHN first creates a Coarsened Line Graph Neural Network (CL-GNN) to excavate edge-centric relation structural features that respect the latent associations of different types of edges based on coarsened line graph. After that, a Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (H-GNN) is used to leverage implicit messages from neighbor nodes and edges propagating among nodes in heterogeneous graphs. As a result, different types of nodes and edges can enhance their embedding through mutual integration and promotion. Experiments and comparisons, based on semi-supervised classification tasks on large scale heterogeneous networks with over a hundred types of edges, show that RSHN significantly outperforms state-of-the-arts.","tags":["Graph Neural Networks"],"title":"Relation Structure-Aware Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Fei Xiong","Weihan Shen","Hongshu Chen","Shirui Pan","Ximeng Wang","Zheng Yan"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1564617600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1564617600,"objectID":"6807559a6be454b3d29deba5a46b7b38","permalink":"https://shiruipan.github.io/publication/tcyb-2019-xiong/","publishdate":"2019-09-05T12:21:15.618572Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tcyb-2019-xiong/","section":"publication","summary":"Social recommender systems have attracted a lot of attention from academia and industry.

Thus, implicit influence propagates among the users who rated the same items, and it has significant impact on users’ ratings.

In this paper, we propose an information propagation-based social recommendation method (SoInp) and model the implicit user influence from the perspective of information propagation.

Our method focuses on attributed graphs to sufficiently explore the two sides of information in graphs. By employing an attention network to capture the importance of the neighboring nodes to a target node, our DAEGC algorithm encodes the topological structure and node content in a graph to a compact representation, on which an inner product decoder is trained to reconstruct the graph structure. Furthermore, soft labels from the graph embedding itself are generated to supervise a self-training graph clustering process, which iteratively refines the clustering results.

Furthermore, existing methods are ineffective to capture the temporal trends as the RNNs or CNNs employed in these methods cannot capture long-range temporal sequences. To overcome these limitations, we propose in this paper a novel graph neural network architecture, Graph WaveNet, for spatial-temporal graph modeling. By developing a novel adaptive dependency matrix and learn it through node embedding, our model can precisely capture the hidden spatial dependency in the data.

Categorizing heterogeneous contexts into two groups, relational context and descriptive context, we design tailor-made matrix factorization formula to effectively exploit the label relatedness in each context. With a shared embedding principle across heterogeneous contexts, the label relatedness is selectively aligned in a shared space. Due to our elegant formulation, PHCLE overcomes the partial context problem and can nicely incorporate more contexts, which both cannot be tackled with existing multi-context label embedding methods.

The optimization of calculation models is still a challenging issue for improving the performance of similarity measurement. In this paper, we investigate WordNet-based measures including distance-based, information-based, feature-based and hybrid. Among them, the distance-based measures are considered to have the lowest computational complexity due to simple distance calculation. However, most of existing works ignore the meronymy relation between concepts and the non-uniformity of path distances caused by various semantic relations, in which path distances are simply determined by conceptual hyponymy relation. To solve this problem, we propose a novel model to calculate the path distance between concepts, and also propose a similarity measure which nonlinearly transforms the distance to semantic similarity. In the proposed model, we assign different weights in accordance with various relations to edges that link different concepts. On basis of the distance model, we use five structure properties of WordNet for similarity measurement, which consist of multiple meanings, multiple inheritance, link type, depth and local density. Our similarity measure is compared against state-of-the-art WordNet-based measures on M\u0026C dataset, R\u0026G dataset and WS-353 dataset. According to experiment results, the proposed measure in this work outperforms others in terms of both Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients, which indicates the effectiveness of our distance model. Besides, we construct six additional benchmarks to prove that the proposed measure maintains stable performance.","tags":["Path distance","Semantic relationship","Semantic similarity","Structure property","WordNet"],"title":"Measuring distance-based semantic similarity using meronymy and hyponymy relations","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Fei Xiong","Ximeng Wang","Shirui Pan","Hong Yang","Haishuai Wang","Chengqi Zhang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"4f21d4a47d21972460465f465fc39f60","permalink":"https://shiruipan.github.io/publication/xiong-social-2019/","publishdate":"2019-09-03T11:36:51.672111Z","relpermalink":"/publication/xiong-social-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"When users in online social networks make a decision, they are often affected by their neighbors. Social recommendation models utilize social information to reveal the impact of neighbors on user preferences, and this impact is often described by the linear superposition of neighbor preferences or by global trust propagation. Further exploration needs to be undertaken to determine whether the influence pattern of other users from online interaction behaviors is adequately described. In this paper, we introduce evolutionary opinion dynamics from the field of statistical physics into recommender systems, characterizing the impact of other users. We propose an opinion dynamic model by evolutionary game theory. To describe online user interactions, we define the strategies during an interaction between two users, and present the payoff for each strategy in terms of errors of estimated ratings. Therefore, user behaviors are associated with their preferences and ratings. In addition, we measure user influence according to their topological roles in the social network. We incorporate evolutionary opinion dynamics and user influence into the recommendation framework for the prediction of unknown ratings. Experiment results on two real-world datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of the-art models in terms of accuracy, and it also performs well for cold-start users. Our method reduces the divergence of user preferences, in accordance with online opinion interactions. Furthermore, our method has approximate computational complexity with matrix factorization, and results in less computation than state-of-the-art models.

Over the last decades, numerous researches have tried to deal with this issue, but none of them has clearly identified the relations among positive-negative UX, sufficient human characteristics and specific events of applications. This paper proposes a subjective-objective evaluation method. Subjective UX of mobile games is sufficiently obtained and objective UX is verified through the electrocardiogram signals and heart rate variability. In order to reveal distinct relations among UX factors, sufficient user characteristics and categories of game events, an improved RIPPER algorithm is proposed by this paper to obtain the relations.

Such a simple feature-vector representation inherently loses the structure information of the objects. In reality, objects may have complicated characteristics, depending on how the objects are assessed and characterized. Meanwhile, the data may come from heterogeneous domains [7], such as traditional tabular-based data, sequential patterns, graphs, time-series information, and semistructured data.

In this paper, we propose an adaptive real-time graph stream classification method to address this challenge. We partition the unbounded graph stream data into consecutive graph chunks, each consisting of a fixed number of graphs and delivering a corresponding chunk-level classifier. We employ a random hashing function to compress the original node set of graphs in each chunk for fast feature detection when training chunk-level classifiers. Furthermore, a differential hashing strategy is applied to map unlimited increasing features (i.e., cliques) into a fixed-size feature space which is then used as a feature vector for stochastic learning. Finally, the chunk-level classifiers are weighted in an ensemble learning model for graph classification.

Bag mapping transforms a bag into a single instance in a new space via instance selection and has drawn significant attention recently. To date, most existing work is based on the original space, using all instances inside each bag for bag mapping, and the selected instances are not directly tied to an MIL objective. As a result, it is difficult to guarantee the distinguishing capacity of the selected instances in the new bag mapping space. In this paper, we propose a discriminative mapping approach for multi-instance learning (MILDM) that aims to identify the best instances to directly distinguish bags in the new mapping space. Accordingly, each instance bag can be mapped using the selected instances to a new feature space, and hence any generic learning algorithm, such as an instance-based learning algorithm, can be used to derive learning models for multi-instance classification. Experiments and comparisons on eight different types of real-world learning tasks (including 14 data sets) demonstrate that MILDM outperforms the state-of-The-Art bag mapping multi-instance learning approaches. Results also confirm that MILDM achieves balanced performance between runtime efficiency and classification effectiveness.","tags":["Classification","Bag mapping","Instance selection","Multi-instance learning"],"title":"Multi-instance learning with discriminative bag mapping","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jia Wu","Shirui Pan","Xingquan Zhu","Chengqi Zhang","Philip S.

Graph learning and classification is a common tool for handling such objects. To date, existing graph classification has been limited to the single-graph setting with each object being represented as one graph from a single structure-view. This inherently limits its use to the classification of complicated objects containing complex structures and uncertain labels. In this paper, we advance graph classification to handle multigraph learning for complicated objects from multiple structure views, where each object is represented as a bag containing several graphs and the label is only available for each graph bag but not individual graphs inside the bag. To learn such graph classification models, we propose a multistructure-view bag constrained learning (MSVBL) algorithm, which aims to explore substructure features across multiple structure views for learning. By enabling joint regularization across multiple structure views and enforcing labeling constraints at the bag and graph levels, MSVBL is able to discover the most effective substructure features across all structure views. Experiments and comparisons on real-world data sets validate and demonstrate the superior performance of MSVBL in representing complicated objects as multigraph for classification, e.g., MSVBL outperforms the state-of-the-art multiview graph classification and multiview multi-instance learning approaches.","tags":["Graph","graph classification","multiview learning","subgraph mining"],"title":"Multiple structure-view learning for graph classification","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Libin Yang","Yu Zheng","Xiaoyan Cai","Shirui Pan","Tao Dai"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"78a3140a79dc2579724a101e4b35dea7","permalink":"https://shiruipan.github.io/publication/yang-query-oriented-2018/","publishdate":"2019-09-03T11:36:51.688019Z","relpermalink":"/publication/yang-query-oriented-2018/","section":"publication","summary":"With the rapid proliferation of information technology, researchers find it more and more difficult to rapidly find appropriate reference papers for an authoring paper.

In this paper, we study a new universum graph classification framework which leverages additional “non-example” graphs to help improve the graph classification accuracy. We argue that although universum graphs do not belong to the target class, they may contain meaningful structure patterns to help enrich the feature space for graph representation and classification. To support universum graph classification, we propose a mathematical programming algorithm, ugBoost, which integrates discriminative subgraph selection and margin maximization into a unified framework to fully exploit the universum. Because informative subgraph exploration in a universum setting requires the search of a large space, we derive an upper bound discriminative score for each subgraph and employ a branch-and-bound scheme to prune the search space. By using the explored subgraphs, our graph classification model intends to maximize the margin between positive and negative graphs and minimize the loss on the universum graph examples simultaneously. The subgraph exploration and the learning are integrated and performed iteratively so that each can be beneficial to the other.

Second, they are mostly shallow methods that can only capture the linear and simple relationships in the data. In this paper, we propose an effective deep learning model, Graph Ladder Networks (GLN), for node classification in networks. Our model learns a ladder network which unifies the representation learning and network classification into one single framework by exploiting both labeled and unlabeled nodes in a network.

However, existing deep approaches for graph clustering can only exploit the structure information, while ignoring the content information associated with the nodes in a graph.

The key innovation of MGAE is that it advances the autoencoder to the graph domain, so graph representation learning can be carried out not only in a purely unsupervised se.ing by leveraging structure and content information, it can also be stacked in a deep fashion to learn effective representation. From a technical viewpoint, we propose a marginalized graph convolutional network to corrupt network node content, allowing node content to interact with network features, and marginalizes the corrupted features in a graph autoencoder context to learn graph feature representations.

In this paper, we formulate a new multitask graph learning problem, and propose a task sensitive feature exploration and learning algorithm for multitask graph classification. Because graphs do not have features available, we advocate a task sensitive feature exploration and learning paradigm to jointly discover discriminative subgraph features across different tasks. In addition, a feature learning process is carried out to categorize each subgraph feature into one of three categories: 1) common feature; 2) task auxiliary feature; and 3) task specific feature, indicating whether the feature is shared by all tasks, by a subset of tasks, or by only one specific task, respectively. The feature learning and the multiple task learning are iteratively optimized to form a multitask graph classification model with a global optimization goal.

Many classification algorithms have been proposed, but they usually require as input fully labeled text examples. In many networked applications, however, the cost to label a text data may be expensive and hence a large amount of text may be unlabeled. In this paper we study the problem of classifying networked text data with only positive and unlabeled examples available. We present a non-negative matrix factorization-based approach to networked text classification by factorizing content matrix of the nodes and topological network structures, and by incorporating supervised information into the learning of objective function via a consensus principle. We propose a novel learning algorithm, namely puNet (positive and unlabeled learning algorithm for Networked text data), for efficiently classifying networked text, even if training datasets contain only a small amount of positive examples and a large amount of unlabeled ones.

In this paper, we argue that due to unique characteristics of enterprise social networks, simple clustering for ESN nodes or using existing topic discovery methods cannot effectively discover functional groups and understand their roles. Alternatively, we propose CENFLD, which carries out co-clustering on enterprise social networks for functional group discovery and understanding. CENFLD is a co-factorization based framework which combines network topology structures and rich content information, including interactions between nodes and correlations between node content, to discover functional user groups. Because the number of functional groups is highly data driven and hard to estimate, CENFLD employs a hold-out test principle to find the group number optimally complying with the underlying data.

Such a multi-graph representation can be used for many real-world applications, such as webpage classification, where a webpage can be regarded as a bag with texts and images inside the webpage being represented as graphs. This problem is a generalization of multi-instance learning (MIL) but with vital differences, mainly because instances in MIL share a common feature space whereas no feature is available to represent graphs in a multi-graph bag.

Given a set of labeled multi-graph bags, bMGC employs dynamic weight adjustment at both bag- and graph-levels to select one subgraph in each iteration as a weak classifier. In each iteration, bag and graph weights are adjusted such that an incorrectly classified bag will receive a higher weight because its predicted bag label conflicts to the genuine label, whereas an incorrectly classified graph will receive a lower weight value if the graph is in a positive bag (or a higher weight if the graph is in a negative bag). Accordingly, bMGC is able to differentiate graphs in positive and negative bags to derive effective classifiers to form a boosting model for MGC.

Although cost-sensitive learning has been extensively studied, all methods are based on data with instance-feature representation. Graphs, however, do not have features available for learning and the feature space of graph data is likely infinite and needs to be carefully explored in order to favor classes with a higher cost. In this paper, we propose, CogBoost, a fast cost-sensitive graph classification algorithm, which aims to minimize the misclassification costs (instead of the errors) and achieve fast learning speed for large scale graph data sets. To minimize the misclassification costs, CogBoost iteratively selects the most discriminative subgraph by considering costs of different classes, and then solves a linear programming problem in each iteration by using Bayes decision rule based optimal loss function. In addition, a cutting plane algorithm is derived to speed up the solving of linear programs for fast learning on large scale data sets.

Due to the lack of explicit features to represent graphs for training classification models, extensive studies have been focused on extracting the most discriminative subgraphs features from the training graph dataset to transfer graphs into vector data. However, such filter-based methods suffer from two major disadvantages: (1) the subgraph feature selection is separated from the model learning process, so the selected most discriminative subgraphs may not best fit the subsequent learning model, resulting in deteriorated classification results; (2) all these methods rely on users to specify the number of subgraph features K, and suboptimally specified K values often result in significantly reduced classification accuracy. In this paper, we propose a new graph classification paradigm which overcomes the above disadvantages by formulating subgraph feature selection as learning a K-dimensional feature space from an implicit and large subgraph space, with the optimal K value being automatically determined. To achieve the goal, we propose a regularized loss minimization-driven (RLMD) feature selection method for graph classification. RLMD integrates subgraph selection and model learning into a unified framework to find discriminative subgraphs with guaranteed minimum loss w.r.t. the objective function. To automatically determine the optimal number of subgraphs K from the exponentially large subgraph space, an effective elastic net and a subgradient method are proposed to derive the stopping criterion, so that K can be automatically obtained once RLMD converges. The proposed RLMD method enjoys gratifying property including proved convergence and applicability to various loss functions.

To tackle concept drifting in graph streams, an instance level weighting mechanism is used to dynamically adjust the instance weight, through which the boosting framework can emphasize on difficult graph samples.

Experiments and comparisons on 36 benchmark data sets collected from University of California, Irvine (UCI) in Weka system demonstrate that locally weighting technologies just slightly outperforms unweighted complex BNCs on ACC and AUC. In other words, although locally weighting could significantly improve the performance of NB (a BNC with simple structure), it could not work well on BNCs with complex structures.

In reality, the pronounced advantage of NB is often challenged by the strong conditional independence assumption between attributes, which may deteriorate the classification performance. Accordingly, numerous efforts have been made to improve NB, by using approaches such as structure extension, attribute selection, attribute weighting, instance weighting, local learning and so on. In this paper, we propose a new Artificial Immune System (AIS) based self-adaptive attribute weighting method for Naive Bayes classification. The proposed method, namely AISWNB, uses immunity theory in Artificial Immune Systems to search optimal attribute weight values, where self-adjusted weight values will alleviate the conditional independence assumption and help calculate the conditional probability in an accurate way. One noticeable advantage of AISWNB is that the unique immune system based evolutionary computation process, including initialization, clone, section, and mutation, ensures that AISWNB can adjust itself to the data without explicit specification of functional or distributional forms of the underlying model. As a result, AISWNB can obtain good attribute weight values during the learning process. Experiments and comparisons on 36 machine learning benchmark data sets and six image classification data sets demonstrate that AISWNB significantly outperforms its peers in classification accuracy, class probability estimation, and class ranking performance.","tags":["Attribute weighting","Artificial Immune Systems","Evolutionary computing","Naive Bayes Self-adaptive"],"title":"Self-adaptive attribute weighting for Naive Bayes classification","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jia Wu","Zhihua Cai","Shirui Pan","Xingquan Zhu","Chengqi Zhang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1388534400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1388534400,"objectID":"af15ac683dc03ebdca4d677c8b1a0754","permalink":"https://shiruipan.github.io/publication/wu-attribute-2014/","publishdate":"2019-09-03T11:36:51.705835Z","relpermalink":"/publication/wu-attribute-2014/","section":"publication","summary":"A Bayesian Network (BN) is a graphical model which can be used to represent conditional dependency between random variables, such as diseases and symptoms. A Bayesian Network Classifier (BNC) uses BN to characterize the relationships between attributes and the class labels, where a simplified approach is to employ a conditional independence assumption between attributes and the corresponding class labels, i.e., the Naive Bayes (NB) classification model. One major approach to mitigate NB's primary weakness (the conditional independence assumption) is the attribute weighting, and this type of approach has been proved to be effective for NB with simple structure. However, for weighted BNCs involving complex structures, in which attribute weighting is embedded into the model, there is no existing study on whether the weighting will work for complex BNCs and how effective it will impact on the learning of a given task. In this paper, we first survey several complex structure models for BNCs, and then carry out experimental studies to investigate the effectiveness of the attribute weighting strategies for complex BNCs, with a focus on Hidden Naive Bayes (HNB) and Averaged One-Dependence Estimation (AODE). Our studies use classification accuracy (ACC), area under the ROC curve ranking (AUC), and conditional log likelihood (CLL), as the performance metrics. Experiments and comparisons on 36 benchmark data sets demonstrate that attribute weighting technologies just slightly outperforms unweighted complex BNCs with respect to the ACC and AUC, but significant improvement can be observed using CLL.","tags":null,"title":"Attribute weighting: how and when does it work for Bayesian Network Classification","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jia Wu","Shirui Pan","Zhihua Cai","Xingquan Zhu","Chengqi Zhang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1388534400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1388534400,"objectID":"434b5d30e3a16bb1211ffccf94d4fb1e","permalink":"https://shiruipan.github.io/publication/wu-dual-2014/","publishdate":"2019-09-03T11:36:51.706669Z","relpermalink":"/publication/wu-dual-2014/","section":"publication","summary":"Naive Bayes (NB) network is a popular classification technique for data mining and machine learning.

As MIL becoming popular in domain specific learning tasks, aggregating multiple feature views to represent multi-instance bags has recently shown promising results, mainly because multiple views provide extra information for MIL tasks. Nevertheless, multiple views also increase the risk of involving redundant views and irrelevant features for learning. In this paper, we formulate a new cross-view feature selection problem that aims to identify the most representative features across all feature views for MIL. To achieve the goal, we design a new optimization problem by integrating both multiview representation and multi-instance bag constraints. The solution to the objective function will ensure that the identified top-m features are the most informative ones across all feature views.

To solve the challenge, we propose a puMGL learning framework which relies on two iteratively combined processes for multigraph learning: (1) deriving features to represent graphs for learning; and (2) deriving discriminative models with only positive and unlabeled graph bags. For the former, we derive a subgraph scoring criterion to select a set of informative subgraphs to convert each graph into a feature space. To handle unlabeled bags, we assign a weight value to each bag and use the adjusted weight values to select most promising unlabeled bags as negative bags. A margin graph pool (MGP), which contains some representative graphs from positive bags and identified negative bags, is used for selecting subgraphs and training graph classifiers.

The wide spread of the graph applications and the inherent complex relationships between graph objects have made the labels of the graph data expensive and/or difficult to obtain, especially for applications involving dynamic changing graph records. While labeled graphs are limited, the copious amounts of unlabeled graphs are often easy to obtain with trivial efforts. In this paper, we propose a framework to build a stream based graph classification model by combining both labeled and unlabeled graphs. Our method, called gSLU, employs an ensemble based framework to partition graph streams into a number of graph chunks each containing some labeled and unlabeled graphs. For each individual chunk, we propose a minimum-redundancy subgraph feature selection module to select a set of informative subgraph features to build a classifier. To tackle the concept drifting in graph streams, an instance level weighting mechanism is used to dynamically adjust the instance weight, through which the subgraph feature selection can emphasize on difficult graph samples. The classifiers built from different graph chunks form an ensemble for graph stream classification. Experiments on real-world graph streams demonstrate clear benefits of using minimum-redundancy subgraph features to build accurate classifiers.
